## Intro

The Protostar VM is the next progression step after Nebula (Exploit Exercises). 

Protostar introduces the following in a friendly way:

- Network programming
- Byte order
- Handling sockets
- Stack overflows
- Format strings
- Heap overflows

The above is introduced in a simple way, starting with simple memory corruption and modification, function redirection, and finally executing custom shellcode.

In order to make this as easy as possible to introduce Address Space Layout Randomisation and Non-Executable memory has been disabled. If you are interested in covering ASLR and NX memory, please see the Fusion page.

In this post I will detail my attempt at solving various levels of this VM.
